Project - CDK5 overexpression (CDK5-OE) in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) 
to recapitulate the anxiety phenotype seen in stressed male 
mice after 2 weeks of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS).

Background to CDK5 & stress:
  Executive Function:
- Cognitive function deficits (Ohman et al. 2007)
- Spatial memory impairment (Mizoguchi et al. 2000)
- Decreased working/short-term memory (Conrad 2010)

  Emotion/Mood:
- Depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and other neuropsychiatric illnesses (Duman 2006; Bangasser & Valentino 2014)
- Prevalence in substance-use coping (Brady & Sinha 2005)

  Overall Health:
- Changes in eating patterns (Yau & Potenza 2013)
- Suppression/dysregulation of immune system (Padget & Glaser 2003)
- Development/progression of certain cancers (Saul et al. 2005; Jacobs & Bovasso 2000) 
  CDK5
- Brain development
- Plasticity
- Cellular metabolism
- Synaptic vesicle exocytosis (interaction with Munc-18)



  Preliminary results:
- Reward-pathway disruptions due to stress
- All animals display anxiogenic behaviors after 28 days of CUS
- Regions of interest: NAc, VTA, mPFC, AMA, HYPO, CA1
NAc
- Males display increased CDK5 expression throughout CUS and displayed anxiogenic phenotypes earlier than females


Hypothesis:
- Elevating NAc CDK5 levels in males is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the anxiogenic phenotype established through CUS 

Experimental Design:
- dCas9 sgRNA design & transformation
- Bilateral viral injection into mouse NAc 
- 7day waiting period for viral CDK5 expression
- Marble Burying Assay:
  - Rodents are placed for thirty minutes in a standard cage filled with 5 cm depth of wood chip bedding with 16 marbles evenly spaced. After thirty minutes the amount of marbles buried is measured. In this procedure a marble is considered buried if 2/3 of the marble is covered with bedding
  - Pictures taken and analyzed by at independent experimenters – to get aggregate of buried vs not buried
- Light Dark Assay
  - Rodents are placed for 6 mins in a box with two sides (one light and one dark) and a middle door for access to both areas. 
  - After 1 min of habituation, the time spent in each side is calculated over the duration of 5 mins. 
  - In addition to time spent, the number of entries into the light side is documented. 
  - Video recorded and time scored
  

Expected Results:
- Increased marble burying & time in dark room within sex for CDK5 animals
- Increased marble burying & time in dark room between sexes (for CDK5 males)





Prism8 used for visualization & data analysis

Graphs generated:
  - Marble Burying
      - QQ plot for Male or Female groups
        - both normal (Gaussian)
      - Bar graphs w/ SEM for individual sexes and a combined figure
        - total number of marbles buried out of 16. Male CDK5-OE trending towards more marbles buried (anxious)
      - Statistics
        - 2-way ANOVA shows sex-effect trend and sex x treatment interaction effect
        ANOVA Table
F (DFn, DFd)
P value
Treatment
F (1, 18) = 2.024
P = 0.1719
Sex
F (1, 18) = 3.726
P = 0.0695
Sex x Treatment
F (1, 18) = 5.890
P = 0.0259

        - Bonferroni multiple correction test shows that there is an effect of treatment in males, 
        and sex effect when both sexes are treated with CDK5 overexpression.

  - Light/Dark Assay
      - QQ plots for Male or Female groups
        - both normal (Gaussian)
      - Bar graphs w/ SEM for individual sexes and 2 combined figures
        - total time spent in the light zone
          - no trends & seemingly no difference between sexes or between control and CDK5-OE groups
        - number of entries into the light zone
          - no trends & seemingly no difference between sexes or between control and CDK5-OE groups
        - Two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons test show no effect of sex or treatment on this task.
