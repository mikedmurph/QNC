Project - CDK5 overexpression (CDK5-OE) in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) 
to recapitulate the anxiety phenotype seen in stressed male 
mice after 2 weeks of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS).

Graphs generated:
  - Marble Burying
      - QQ plot for Male or Female groups
        - both normal (Gaussian)
      - Bar graphs w/ SEM for individual sexes and a combined figure
        - total number of marbles buried out of 16. Male CDK5-OE trending towards more marbles buried (anxious)
      - Statistics
        - 2-way ANOVA shows sex-effect trend and sex x treatment interaction effect
        ANOVA Table
F (DFn, DFd)
P value
Treatment
F (1, 18) = 2.024
P = 0.1719
Sex
F (1, 18) = 3.726
P = 0.0695
Sex x Treatment
F (1, 18) = 5.890
P = 0.0259

        - Bonferroni multiple correction test shows that there is an effect of treatment in males, 
        and sex effect when both sexes are treated with CDK5 overexpression.

  - Light/Dark Assay
      - QQ plots for Male or Female groups
        - both normal (Gaussian)
      - Bar graphs w/ SEM for individual sexes and 2 combined figures
        - total time spent in the light zone
          - no trends & seemingly no difference between sexes or between control and CDK5-OE groups
        - number of entries into the light zone
          - no trends & seemingly no difference between sexes or between control and CDK5-OE groups
        - Two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons test show no effect of sex or treatment on this task.
