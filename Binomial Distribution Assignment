%% Exercise 1
% Note that omitting the semicolon at the end of a line causes the output
% to be shown in the Command Window.
n = 10;                       % Number of available quanta
pRelease = 0.2;               % Release probabilty 
k = 0:10;                     % Possible values of k (measured events)
probs = binopdf(k,n,pRelease) % Array of probabilities of obtaining those values of k, given n and prelease

%% Exercise 2
n = 14;                       % Number of available quanta
k = 8;                        % Measured number of released quanta
prob1  = binopdf(k,n,0.1)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.1
prob2  = binopdf(k,n,0.2)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.2
prob3  = binopdf(k,n,0.3)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.3
prob4  = binopdf(k,n,0.4)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.4
prob5  = binopdf(k,n,0.5)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.5
prob6  = binopdf(k,n,0.6)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.6 ** MOST LIKELY
prob7  = binopdf(k,n,0.7)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.7
prob8  = binopdf(k,n,0.8)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.8
prob9  = binopdf(k,n,0.9)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 0.9
prob10 = binopdf(k,n,1.0)     % Probabilty of obtaining k if release p = 1.0

%% Exercise 3
% Likelihood and log-likelihood for sample size = 2, assumed pRelease=0.1
n1 = 14;                      % Number of available quanta, experiment 1
n2 = 14;                      % Number of available quanta, experiment 2
k1 = 8;                       % Measured number of released experiment 1
k2 = 5;                       % Measured number of released experiment 2
pRelease = 0.1;               % Assumed probability of release
prob1 = binopdf(k1,n1,pRelease) % Probabilty of obtaining data 1 (k1) given n1, prelease
prob2 = binopdf(k2,n2,pRelease) % Probabilty of obtaining data 2 (k2) given n2, prelease
totalProb = prob1 * prob2     % Assume independence and compute product
totalLogProb = log(prob1) + log(prob2) % Assume independence and compute sum

% likelihood and log-likelihood functions for sample size = 2
ps = (0:0.01:1.0)';           % Array of possible release probabilities -- compute
                              % at a resolution of 0.01
nps = length(ps);             % Get length of array of values of p
probs = binopdf( ....         % Get value of the binomial distribution for each
   repmat([k1 k2], nps, 1), ...  % combination of k, n, p. The output is a matrix
   repmat([n1 n2], nps, 1), ...  % with two rows: 1) n1, k1  2) n2, k2
   repmat(ps, 1, 2));            % columns are different values of p

% The likelihood function is the product of likelihoods (assuming
% independence)
subplot(2,1,1); cla reset; hold on;
ylabel('Likelihood');
likelihoodFcn = prod(probs,2);   % Compute the product
plot(ps, likelihoodFcn);         % Plot it
maxLikelihood = max(likelihoodFcn); % Get the maximum likelihood
plot(ps(likelihoodFcn==maxLikelihood), maxLikelihood, 'ko');

% The log-likelihood function is the sum of log-likelihoods (assuming
% independence)
subplot(2,1,2); cla reset; hold on;
ylabel('Log-likelihood');
logLikelihoodFcn = sum(log(probs),2); % Compute the sum
plot(ps, logLikelihoodFcn);      % Plot it
maxLogLikelihood = max(logLikelihoodFcn); % Get the maximum likelihood
plot(ps(logLikelihoodFcn==maxLogLikelihood), maxLogLikelihood, 'ko');

% Likelihood and log-likelihood functions for different sample sizes.
%
% The code below will produce three plots that will update automatically 
%  for different sample sizes. You should see that as sample size increases, 
%  the ability to estimate the true value of the probability of release 
%  increases. You will also see an advantage of using log-likelihood over 
%  likelihood: as the number of samples increases, the total likelihood 
%  (the product of the likeilihoods associated with each measurement in 
%  the sample) eventually disappears, because Matlab can't handle the 
%  really small numbers (note that as the sample size increases, the 
%  number of all possible experimental outcomes you could measure gets 
%  really, really big, so the total likelihood of any GIVEN outcome gets 
%  really, really small). The three plots are:
%
%  TOP: normalized histogram of simulated experimental outcomes (i.e.,
%  simulated values of k for the given release probability and sample
%  size), along with the theoretical binomial distribution
%
%  MIDDLE: likelihood function, p(simulated data | pRelease)
%  Also shown are the maximum likelihood (peak of the likelihood function)
%  determined directly from the plotted likelihood function plus the value
%  (and 95% confidence intervals) computed using Matlab's "binofit" function
%  fit to the simulated data, plus the value of pRelease used in the
%  simulations.
% 
%  BOTTOM: Same as in the middle panel, but using the log-likelihood
%  function

   % Use binofit to estimate p from the simulated data. This uses a trick
   % that assumes all of the measurements are independent and lumps them

%% Exercise 4
%
% Note that like good Matlab programmers, we'll do this without loops
counts = [0	0 3 10 19 26 16 16 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]; % The experimental outcomes
n = length(counts)-1;   % Number of available quanta in each experiment
ks = 0:n;               % Possible values of k, as a row vector
nks = length(ks);       % Length of k
ps = (0:0.01:1.0)';     % Possible values of release probability, as a column vector
nps = length(ps);       % Length of p

% Compute the value of the binomial distribution for each possible value of 
%  k, n, p. Make a matrix in which:
%     - columns correspond to different values of p
%     - rows correspond to different values of k
probs = binopdf( ...
   repmat(ks, nps, 1), ...    % Repeat ks-row vector for each p
   n, ...                     % Always assuming the same 'n'
   repmat(ps, 1, nks));       % Repeat ps-column vector for each k

% Make a matrix of outcomes (in rows) that are repeated along the columns so we can
% use them to compute likelihoods for each possible value of release probability (p)
countsMatrix = repmat(counts, nps, 1);

% Compute likelihood function, which takes the product of all likelihoods
% associated with each measured outcome. 
likelihoodFcn = prod(probs.^countsMatrix,2);
pHat_fromLiklihood = ps(likelihoodFcn==max(likelihoodFcn))

% Compute log-likelihood function, which takes the sum of all log-likelihoods
% associated with each measured outcome. 
logLikelihoodFcn = sum(log(probs).*countsMatrix,2);
pHat_fromLogLikelihood = ps(logLikelihoodFcn==max(logLikelihoodFcn))

% use binofit
pHat = binofit(sum(counts.*ks),sum(counts)*n)

%% Exercise 5
n = 14;                       % Number of available quanta
k = 7;                        % Measured number of released quanta
pHat = binofit(k,n)           % Compute maximum-likelihood value of p
pNull = 0.3;                  % Null hypothesis p
prob = binopdf(k,n,pNull)    % p>0.05, so cannot rule out that we would have gotten this measurement by chance under the null hypothesis
