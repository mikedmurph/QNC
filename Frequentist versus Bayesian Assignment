% Frequentist versus Bayesian Statistics
%
% To use this tutorial, read the commands and execute the code line-by-line.
%
% The learning objective is to gain insights into thinking about inference
% from a "Frequentist" versus a "Bayesian" perspective. In brief, because a
% Frequentist does not consider the probability of an event or state of the
% world or hypothesis, only their frequency of occurrance, it is not possible 
% to ask questions of the form "what is the probabilty that hypothesis x is
% true?" Instead, one can only consider questions of the form, "what is the
% probabilty that I would have obtained my data, given that hypothesis x
% is true?" In contrast, Bayesians consider the probabilities of such
% things (often called the strength of belief), but doing so can require
% making assumptions that can be difficult to prove.

% Let's start with a simple example, taken from:
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy#Example_1:_HIV

% "Imagine running an HIV test on" A SAMPLE "of 1000 persons ..."
N = 10000; % size of the SAMPLE

% "The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05)..."
% i.e., the probability that someone who takes the test gets a POSITIVE 
%  result despite the fact that the person does NOT have HIV
falsePositiveRate = 0.05; 

% "...and no false negative rate."
% i.e., The probability that someone who takes the test gets a NEGATIVE 
%  result despite the fact that the person DOES have HIV
falseNegativeRate = 0;

% Question #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically
% significant"?
%
% Answer: Statistical significance from the Frequentist perspective is 
%  typically measured by comparing p to a threshold value; e.g., p<0.05.
%  In this case, "p" is shorthand for "the probabilty of obtaining the 
%  data under the Null Hypothesis", so we are checking for:
%     p(data | Null Hypothesis) < 0.05. 
%  Here we take the Null Hypothesis as "not infected", and the data are 
%  just the single positive test. 
%
%  Therefore, the relvant p-value is simply the false-positive rate: 
%  p=0.05, which is typically considered "not significant." However, 
%  you can also see that it is not particularly informative.
p = falsePositiveRate;

% Question #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive
%  test, that person is infected?
%
% Answer: Here we are asking for a different probability:
%  p(infected | positive test) = p(hypothesis | data) = the "posterior
%  probability" of the hypothesis, given the data.
%
% Let's work our way backwards to figure out what information we need to 
%  solve this problem.
%
% We can compute the probability that someone with a positive test is 
%  infected from a particular population as:
% pIsInfectedGivenIsPositiveTest = sum(isInfected&isPositive)./sum(isPositive);
%
% (I am keeping this commented out right now because the variables on
%  the right-hand side of the equation are not defined yet, so Matlab would
%  give an error if we try to evaluate that expression.)
%
% It should be obvious that to compute this quantity, we need to know the
%  number of people in the population who are actually infected (i.e., we
%  need to compute the number of people corresponding to isInfected ==
%  true), in addition to knowing the number of people who had a positive
%  test.
%
% So let's start by definining how many in the population are actually
%  infected. We'll start by assuming that that *real* rate of infection is
%  0.5 (i.e., half the POPULATION is infected), and then do a quick 
%  simulation to find out how many in our SAMPLE of N people are infected.
%  We can do this simulation by by getting N picks from a 
%  binomial distribution, where each pick determines "isInfected" for a
%  single person according to the assumed rate of infection:
isInfected = logical(binornd(1,0.5,N,1));

% Now we can count the number infected
nInfected = sum(isInfected);

% Now we need to count the number of people who got a positive test in this
%  example. There is no false negative rate, which implies that everyone
%  who is infected got a positive test:
isPositive = isInfected;

% But there is a non-zero false-positive rate, which implies that some of 
%  the people who are not infected will also have a positive test. We
%  can use binornd again to generate random picks from a binomial 
%  distribtuion according to the false-positive rate:
isPositive(~isInfected) = logical(binornd(1, falsePositiveRate, sum(~isInfected), 1));

% Now we can compute the probability that someone with a positive test is
%  infected:
pIsInfectedGivenIsPositiveTest = sum(isInfected&isPositive)./sum(isPositive);

% Let's do the same thing, but this time we will try different values for 
% the proportion of the population that is actually infected. What you
% should notice is that the PROPORTION INFECTED GIVEN A POSITIVE TEST
% depends (a lot!) on the OVERALL RATE OF INFECTION. Put another way, to
% determine the probabilty of a hypothesis, given your data 
% (e.g., proportion infected given a positive test), you have to know the
% probability that the hypothesis was true without any data.
%
% Why is this the case? It is a simple consequence of the definition of 
% a conditional probability, formulated as Bayes' Rule. Specifically,
% the joint probability of two events, call them A and B, is defined as:
% p(A and B) = p(A) * p(A | B)
% p(B and A) = p(B) * p(A | B)
%
% Now, calling A the Hypothesis and B the Data, then rearranging, we
% get:
% p(Hypothesis | Data) = p(Data | Hypothesis) * p(Hypothesis)
%                        ------------------------------------
%                                       p(Data)
%
% So you cannot calculate the probability of the hypothesis, given the
% data (i.e., the Bayesian posterior), without knowing the probability 
% of the hypothesis independent of any data (i.e., the prior)
infectedProportions = 0:0.1:1.0;
for ii = 1:length(infectedProportions)
   
   % Simulate # infections in the SAMPLE, given the POPULATION rate
   isInfected = logical(binornd(1,infectedProportions(ii),N,1));
   
   % Count the number infected
   nInfected = sum(isInfected);
   
   % Make array of positive tests, given that falseNegativeRate=0 ...
   isPositive = isInfected;
   
   % And falsePositiveRate > 0
   isPositive(~isInfected) = logical(binornd(1, falsePositiveRate, sum(~isInfected), 1));
   
   % The probability that someone with a positive test is infected
   pIsInfectedGivenIsPositiveTest = sum(isInfected&isPositive)./sum(isPositive);
   
   % We can compute the Bayesian Posterior as:
   % p(hypothesis | data) = (p(data | hypothesis) * p(hypothesis)) / p(data)
   % Note that we are using the true rate from the full POPULATION, 
   % so these predictions will differ slightly from the probability computed 
   % above (pIsInfectedGivenIsPositiveTest) from the SAMPLE
   pDataGivenHypothesis = 1 - falseNegativeRate;
   pHypothesis = infectedProportions(ii);
   pData = sum(isPositive)./length(isPositive);   
   pHypothesisGivenData = (pDataGivenHypothesis * pHypothesis) / pData;

   % Compute the theoretial posterior probability: 
   disp(sprintf('Infection rate=%.1f, proportion infected given a positive test=%.3f, Posterior=%.3f', ... 
      infectedProportions(ii), pIsInfectedGivenIsPositiveTest, pHypothesisGivenData))
end
